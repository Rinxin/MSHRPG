This is the start of creating a Foundry vtt System and compendium for Marvel Super Heroes RPG.  I'm still trying to decide if there should be an 1984 and a 1986 version.  I will also most likely slowly work the expansions into the assests and possibliy into options for character creation.

This will be a long running project for the current overview, and I do intend to private once past the 50% completion to charge for my time in creating the system file. I do not know on how I will work the compendium files as the source is public domain, but the work I'm putting into this may require purchasing.

More to Follow.
